1. It is difficult to define what life is 
2. Characteristics of life:
	1. Organization
	   
	2. Homeostasis - is the maintenance of stable internal environment within an organism, despite changes in the external environment. It means to keep the internal environment balanced - even when the world around us changes, the internal world keeps balance. It always adjusts temperature, water levels, pH, oxygen, blood sugar.
	   
	3. Metabolism - is set of all chemical reactions that occur within a living organism to maintain life. It is everything your body does to turn food into energy and build/fix itself. It breaks down things, build up things. Catabolism - breaking down molecules to release energy. Anabolism - building new molecules using energy.
	   
	4. Reproduction - is the biological process by which new individual organisms are produced from their parents. It means making new life. It is how living things make babies or offspring - so their kind doesn't disappear. Asexual reproduction - one parent, genetically identical to the parent, fast and simple. Bacteria splitting in two. Reproduction keeps species alive. It passes on genetic info. 
	   
	5. Growth & Development
	   
	6. Response Stimuli - is a reaction by an organism to changes in its internal or external environment. You touch heat -> pull away your hand. Plants grow toward sunlight. You feel cold -> shiver.
	   
	7. Evolution - is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over generations through processes such as natural selections and genetic mutation. It means species change over time. Living things slowly adapt to their environment. Small changes in DNA happen. 
	   
	   Mutation -> Random changes in DNA 
	   
	   Natural Selection -> good traits help survival -> passed on 
	   
	   Adaptation -> traits help an organism survive better 
	   
	   All living things share ancient ancestors
