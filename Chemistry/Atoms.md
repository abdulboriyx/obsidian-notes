Atom is the basic building block of matter

Atoms are made up of subatomic particles which are called protons, neutrons and electrons

Nucleus - is the dense center of an atom that contains protons and neutrons
	- Nucleus is the core of an atom 
	  
	- It sits right in the middle
	  
	- It contains -> protons and neurtons 
	  
	- The number of protons in the nucleus tells you what element it is

Electron cloud - is the are around the nucleus where electrons move
	- electrons don't stay in one spot - they move fast
	
	- we don't know exactly where an electron is but we know where it is likely to be
	
	- that likely zone is called the electron cloud

Subatomic Particles differ on their charges. 
	- Protons has 1+ charge
	- Electrons has 1- charge
	- Neutrons has 0 charge

u - is the unit for mass of the subatomic particles 

Protons and Neutrons have 1u. Electrons have 0.0005 u.
