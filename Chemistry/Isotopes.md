1. Atoms of the same element with same number of protons and different number of neutrons are called - isotopes

2. Mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons
   
3. Isotopes applied:
	1. Carbon has two different isotopes. 
	   
	2. One has 6 neutrons and other has 7 neutrons
	   
	3. Mass number of first one is 12 = 6 protons + 6 neutrons -> 12/6 C
	   
	4. If Isotope of sodium is: 23/11 Na, then how many neutrons does it have? 
	   Well, so first, we know that mass number (23) is number of protons + number of neutrons. If atomic number (which is number of protons) is 11, then we subtract 11 from 23 (mass number) to get number of neutrons which is 12. 

Example practices for isotopes:
1. what is the mass number of $\frac{35}{17}$ C? neutrons? 
   Mass number is 35. There are 18 neutrons of the isotope 
2. What is the mass number $\frac{40}{20}$ Ca? What is the protons? 
   Well, mass number is 40. Protons are given, and it is 20. 
3. $\frac{14}{6}$C, find protons and neutrons
   Well, protons are six, mass number is 14, therefore (14-6) neutrons are 8
4. $\frac{16}{8}$ O, find all three:
   well, mass number is 16, number of protons is 8, so is number of neutrons, 8 
5. $\frac{39}{19}$ K, find protons and neutrons:
   well, mass number is 39, protons are 19, so neutrons are 20 
6. $\frac{56}{26}$ Fe, find mass number and neutrons:
   mass number is 56, protons are 26, and neutrons are 30
