An ion is an atom or molecule that has a net electric charge because it has gained or lost electrons.

- Atoms want their outermost electron shells to be full to be stable
- To do so, they lose or gain electrons during chemical reactions
- if they lose electron and become positive charged, they are called cation
- If they gain electron and become negative charged, they are called anion

Example:
1. Sodium (Na): loses 1 electron -> becomes Na+ 
2. Chlorine (Cl): gains 1 electron -> becomes Cl-


An element X can form ions or bonds with element Y:
- if Y needs to gain electrons and X can lose electrons
However, if element Z also tends to lose electrons rather than gain them:
- X and Z are unlikely to form ions by electron transfer.
